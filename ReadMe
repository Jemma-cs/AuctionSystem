<< Description >>

< Aim of the program>

As online trading of second-hand products is growing rapidly in recent years, our team is required to build a Second-hand Auction software to enable a trading platform. This system is aiming for providing convenient and completed functions to satisfy users' demands on publishing and finishing transactions.

< Mechanism of auction process >

User' s items created will be stored in each account' s private stock. Two independent tags can be attached to an item, named "New" and "Virtual". Those published items with required information will create an auction pending for audition. Audition will be done by the system administrator. Only those approved auctions will be activated for global access, while declined ones will be canceled and change item state back to unpublished.
Users can browse only activated auctions and have no authority to manage auction lists. Users should be able to browse the entire activated auction list or search according to a specific tag attached to sold items. They can only withdraw their own auctions or participate in bidding of others' auctions.
A transaction can only be done when conditions of finishing an auction are satisfied. The payment will be done using credit cards bound to seller and buyer’s accounts.
